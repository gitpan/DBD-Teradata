NAME
    DBD::Teradata - DBI driver for Teradata

SYNOPSIS
      use DBI;

      $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:Teradata:hostname', 'user', 'password');

    See DBI for more information.

DESCRIPTION
    Refer to the included doc/index.html, or
    <http://www.presicient.com/tdatdbd> for detailed information.

  PREREQUISITES
    Install Perl (minimum version 5.8).

    Build, test and install the DBI module (minimum version 1.36).

    Remember to *read* the DBI README, this README, and the included
    doc/index.html CAREFULLY!

    I had a lot of info to distill, and POD, though quaint and convenient
    for READMEs like this, just isn't as expressive as HTML...hence
    doc/index.html. Please refer to doc/index.html for detailed usage
    information.

  *** BUILDING:
   NOTE
    The provided test suite is not suitable for normal Perl "make test", as
    it requires a Teradata database and a username and password for an
    account with various privileges (e.g., CREATE PROCEDURE).

    After installing, you can verify the install by running

            perl t/test.pl <host> <user> <password>

    where <host> is the name of your Teradata server. NOTE that CLI does NOT
    support numeric IP addresses, nor addresses with the COPn suffix already
    applied, i.e.,

            perl t/test.pl 129.123.345.78 dbc dbc   # WRONG

            perl t/test.pl DBCCOP1 dbc dbc          # WRONG

            perl t/test.pl DBC dbc dbc              # RIGHT!

   Building For Microsoft Windows
    You'll need the nmake utility, available with the various Visual Studio
    tools. You'll also need to make sure your command prompt is configured
    to find nmake; see the Visual Studio documents for how to do that.

    To build:

        perl Makefile.pl    # use a perl that's in your PATH
        nmake
        nmake install

   Building For UNIX/Linux
        perl Makefile.pl    # use a perl that's in your PATH
        make
        make install

  IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS
    Please read the doc/index.html file which includes important
    information, including tips and workarounds for various
    platform-specific problems.
