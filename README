               Build, test and install Perl 5 (minimum version 5.005).
               It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

               Build, test and install the DBI module (minimum version 1.13).
               It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

               Remember to *read* the DBI README, this README, and the included
               tdatdbd.html CAREFULLY!

               I had a lot of info to distill, and POD, though quaint and
               convenient for READMEs like this, just isn't as expressive
               as HTML...hence tdatdbd.html. Please refer to tdatdbd.html for
               detailed usage information.

               Define the following environment variables:
               (These are used to logon the sessions for the test.pl script.)

                       TDAT_DBD_DSN - set to your DBMS's hostname (e.g., 'dbccop1')
                       TDAT_DBD_USER - set to the userid that has about 4 MBytes of
                               perm space and can create/drop tables and macros
                       TDAT_DBD_PASSWORD - set to the password for aforementioned userid

               For Windows 95/98/2000/ME/NT:

               Save us all a great deal of agony, and just copy Teradata.pm
               to your site-specific lib\DBD directory (e.g., \perl\site\lib\DBD
               for most ActiveState configurations) (backup your old copy if you're
               upgrading!!!), and then copy test.pl somewhere and run

                       perl -w test.pl

               and make sure you get all the way to the
               "Tests completed ok, exitting..." output at the end.

               For non-Windows:

           perl Makefile.pl    # use a perl that's in your PATH
           make
           make test                   # will spew results to STDOUT,
                                               # messages to STDERR,
                                               # and create a tdrawtest.out file
           make install (if the tests look okay)
